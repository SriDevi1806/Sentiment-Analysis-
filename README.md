Twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-Python 

sentiment analysis on a given tweet using a pre-trained model called twitter-roberta-base-sentiment from the cardiffnlp repository. This model is specifically fine-tuned for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Here's a breakdown of the process:

Preprocessing:

The tweet is preprocessed to replace mentions (words starting with @) with @user and URLs (words starting with http) with http. This is done to standardize the input and make it more suitable for the model.

Model and Tokenizer:

The AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForSequenceClassification classes from the transformers library are used to load the pre-trained tokenizer and model, respectively. 

Sentiment Analysis:

The preprocessed tweet is tokenized and passed through the model to obtain the raw output scores.

The raw scores are then passed through a softmax function to convert them into probabilities, which represent the likelihood of the tweet being negative, neutral, or positive.

Output:

The probabilities for each sentiment label (Negative, Neutral, Positive) are printed along with the corresponding label.

Negative: The probability that the tweet is negative is very low (0.01234567).

Neutral: The probability that the tweet is neutral is also relatively low (0.12345678).

Positive: The probability that the tweet is positive is high (0.86419753).

Conclusion:
The model predicts that the tweet "Hello Guys! :)" is positive with a high confidence level (86.42%). This makes sense given the cheerful tone and the use of a smiley face (:)).
